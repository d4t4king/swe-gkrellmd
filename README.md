# swe-gkrellmd

## What is it?

gkrellmd is a system monitoring daemon for linux.  It has been ported to work on Windows and macOS, and various flavors of UNIX (\*BSD and Solaris).  This repository represents a modification ("mod"), or add-on, for Smoothwall Express linux firewall distribution.  If you're not using Smoothwall Express, you probably don't need to use this repository.  If you are using the commercial version of Smoothwall, a.k.a. Smoothwall UTM, you _definitely_ don't want to use the repository.
